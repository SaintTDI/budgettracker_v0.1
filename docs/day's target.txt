*Until July's end - finalize items first
*Continue functional phase before the design phase
*You'd just know if it's time to move on


deletion/obsolescence of related objects
- owner being deleted - use (none)?

x fix function trigger for new inflows and outflows incl. dynamic calc of outstanding amount


outflows
- incur functionality

owner summaries
- show summary - dynamic

credit card-related expenses
- automatic cycle selection based on date

allotment related cash flows
- increase and decrease allotments


miscellaneous
- decimals for values and amount - Javascript
- error checking - number input instead string and vice versa
- improve cycles (dates are automatically continuous)

refactor - before UI
- refactor handling of parent-child tables: use join instead of double db access
- avoid using * in select statements meant to acces ID only
- revise how related input fields are being accessed (find a way to group them. use class if no other means is available)

others
- add currency to budget manager
- deferred - when a cashflow is moved to another cycle - a copy is created and the original is disabled.
